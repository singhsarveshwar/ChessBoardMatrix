Project Name: Chessboard Matrix Operations in C#

Description:
This project implements a chessboard matrix type in C#, where every second entry is zero. The matrix stores only the nonzero entries in row-major order. It provides methods for accessing matrix entries, performing addition and multiplication operations on matrices, and printing the matrix in an m by n shape.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: C#
- Data Structures: Lists
- Methods: Getter for matrix entry, matrix addition, matrix multiplication, matrix printing

Key Features:
- Chessboard matrix implementation with alternating nonzero and zero entries
- Efficient storage of only nonzero entries in row-major order
- Accessing matrix entries by index
- Addition and multiplication operations between chessboard matrices
- Printing the matrix in an m by n shape for visualization

Contributions:
Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to suggest improvements or submit pull requests to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the chessboard matrix operations.

Note: The project assumes a basic understanding of C# programming and matrix operations.
